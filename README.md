# Digital Garden

A CLI tool for the creation and maintenance of Digital Gardens.

## Tips

- `cargo run`
- `cargo run -- write`
- `cargo watch`
- `cmd + .` to add highlighted item to scope (if possible) 
- `cargo fmt`

## Commands

### Setting the garden path

```shell
GARDEN_PATH=~/github/my-digital-garden garden write
garden -p ~/github/my-digital-garden write
garden --garden-path ~/github/my-digital-garden write
```

###Â write

Open a new file to write in our digital garden. Since we don't necessarily know what we want to title what we're writing, we'll eave the title as optinal and ask the user for it later if they don't provide it up-front.

```shell
dg write
dg write -t "Some title"
```
